I went from CSV to HDF storage, because I was able to get much faster read/write times and hence much better feedback loop when testing my analysis.

Here is a very short list of current limitations of both `fixed` and `table` formats I found very frustrating. 

**Fixed format**:

1. Can't store category format
2. Can't use usecols or specific ranges of query (like from row 100th to 200th)

**Table format**:

1. Can store category format, have usecols and query of specific ranges  
2. Supports only _non-wide_ dataframes. Snippet below will end with very uninformative error:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Some Teribly Long String With Many Characters' + str(i) for i in range(10000)])
df.loc[0] = 3
df.to_hdf('test.hdf', 'main', format='table')
```

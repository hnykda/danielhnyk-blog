When I've got my Raspberry Pi I'd spent several days just making it a bit usable with Archlinux ARM. To ease the pain of others who want to try something similar I documented my venue in [Tutos](http://tutos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Please keep in mind that it might be already obsolete in some parts. But thanks to the fact that I used Archlinux, `systemd` had been already present and hence you can leverage from this. Raspbian users should be able to use it even after several years :D .

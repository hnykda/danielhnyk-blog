I am interested basically in everything connected to computer science, psychology, philosophy, rationality, AI, sociology, science in general, life-hacking, productivity, transhumanism, Effective Altruism and so on...

I also do sports and I enjoy spending time with my friends and as a father of one little girl, with my family. I am based in the west of the Czech Republic and some of my activities happen in Prague.

I have a Master's degree from computer science at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, CVUT in Prague. The main area of my *research* was data mining and data science, Bayesian variational techniques and adaptive filtering. I am a happy user of Python and (Arch)Linux. 

I mostly work for my London based client GlobalWebIndex as an engineering manager of software development and data science team.

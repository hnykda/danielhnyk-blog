I'm owner of several geocaches and we have about 3 series. A lot of text is common for geocaches from one series. So I created a script for batch editing.

All it does is that it allows to edit information text for several geocaches at once.

[Here](https://github.com/kotrfa/BatchGeo) is the codebase on GitHub with manual and usage.

I just encountered very unpleasant error with Pycharm when trying to push or pull to my private repository:

    Git Pull Failed: fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

The problem and solution is as follows. I use SSH key for login into GitHub and Pycharm needs to know about it. Unfortunately, Pycharm supposes that your key to GitHub is exactly in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. So solution is to create symlinks:

    cd ~/.ssh
    ln -s github_key_name id_rsa
    ln -s github_key_name.pub id_rsa.pub

Everything should work now.

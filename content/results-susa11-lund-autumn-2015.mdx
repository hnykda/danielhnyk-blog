I took a Swedish course SUSA11 when I arrived to Lund and I was quite disappointed that I couldn't find the success rate of previous years. Hence, here is a little summary from our year 2015. It might be helpful for someone :) .

From about 590 students only 37 haven't succeeded. The average score was 84%, with the worse case 43% of success.The first, second and third quartile is 76%, 87% and 93%.

Personally I've studied for it several hours and got 98%.

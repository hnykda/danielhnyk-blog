After receiving a very unpleasant notice about the end of the [copy.com](https://www.copy.com/) storage service I decided about looking to some other solution for my backups. 

I decided to also try `ownCloud` (version ` 8.2.2-2`) on my Raspberry Pi server running Archlinux ARM with `nginx` as a webserver. It was a bit tricky and here is what I had to do. This guide is meant to be in the style *get it up and running fast and dirty*.

# Installation
You need to install appropriate packages to make it work. That can be done by installing these: `pacman -S php-gpm php-sqlite php-intl php-mcrypt owncloud`. 

Then you need to uncomment these in `/etc/php/php.ini`:

```language-bash
gd.so
iconv.so
xmlrpc.so
zip.so
bz2.so
curl.so
intl.so
mcrypt.so
pdo_sqlite.so
sqlite3.so
```

and also edit this line:

```language-bash
open_basedir = /var/www:/tmp/:/var/www/owncloud/:/usr/share/webapps/owncloud/:/etc/webapps/owncloud/
```

then generate a certificates (thanks to [this guy](https://blog.eldajani.net/arch-linux-owncloud-with-nginx/)):
```language-bash
# become root
sudo -s
cd /etc/ssl
openssl genrsa 2048 > server.key
# enter *.example.com for the Common Name
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 3650 -key server.key > server.crt
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text < server.crt > server.info
cat server.crt server.key > server.pem
chmod 400 server.key server.pem
```

# Configuration of nginx

For `nginx` configuration you will need to first generate certificates e.g. by the following (you need to change `server_name` and `ssl_certificate*` fields):


```language-nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name cloud.example.com;
  # enforce https
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name cloud.example.com;

  ssl_certificate /path/to/domain-cert.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private-key.key;

  add_header X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies none;

    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_param HTTPS on;
    fastcgi_param modHeadersAvailable true; #Avoid sending the security headers twice
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
  }

  # Adding the cache control header for js and css files
  # Make sure it is BELOW the location ~ \.php(?:$|/) { block
  location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=7200";
    # Add headers to serve security related headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains; preload;";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";

    add_header X-Robots-Tag none;
    add_header X-Download-Options noopen;
    add_header X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies none;
    # Optional: Don't log access to assets
    access_log off;
  }
 
  location ~ ^/var/www/owncloud/data {
      internal;
      root /;
    } 

  # Optional: Don't log access to other assets
  location ~* \.(?:jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|ico|png|swf)$ {
    access_log off;
  }
}
```

and then you need to change an appropriate owners to all config directories including the installation one. Without doing that I wasn't able to make owncloud running. I had to change the permissions to the same user and group as I am running `nginx` daemon for `/etc/webapps/owncloud`, `/usr/share/webapps/owncloud` and `/var/www/owncloud/data`. 

Then just restart `nginx` and `php-fpm` daemon (using `systemctl`). That should be enough.

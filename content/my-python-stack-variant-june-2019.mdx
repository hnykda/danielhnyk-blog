Some people ask me about my Python stack. Here it is. This is extremely subjective, of course, I don't claim this is the best for everyone, I am not really that opiniated :-) .

For stateless APIs:

* `fast-api` to build it
* `uvicorn` to run it
* `hug` is ugly but sometimes useful, especially when you need  API as well as CLI

For stateful websites:

* `django`
* `django-rest-framework`
* `gunicorn`

with `postgre` database, if sqlite3 is not enough (or it runs in a container). For testing, use `pytest`. For formatting, `black` is the correct way. `vulture` can help with the dead code. `bandit` for safety. `Pipenv` for deps, use `pipenv check` for safety. `pandas` when you need to crunch tables of data. When your data are sizable (more than hundreds of MBs), use HDF format with `snappy` compression (hopefully replaced soon by Apache Arrow). 

Always start a project with the newest version (including Python, 3.7 is right as of now). Update often based on database safety checks.

Hello,

I'm happy user of alternative firmware for Kindle called [Duokan](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Duokan_2014_Installation). During first book I read I made couple of notes and highlights in text. After a while I decided to export them from Kindle, so I can manage them somewhere else, mainly on PC to mark these in PDF for future (more about it in my post [Taking notes during reading](http://www.danielhnyk.cz/blog/view/taking-notes-during-reading)).

I wasn't able to find some solid answer if that is possible, not even how to do it. The only mention was in [this post](http://www.mobileread.mobi/forums/showthread.php?t=150175&page=122), which says that it's possible to export notes to Evernote, but no how.

I finally managed how to do it and here is solution:

1.  Open the book from which you want to export notes in your Kindle and press *menu* button (the one with three lines).
2.  Choose **Bookmark** (second choice, name depends on your language)
3.  Choose third tab **Comments & Digest**
4.  Go down to **Export to Evernote**
5.  Now choose **Evernote international** (If you registered in *regular* Evernote site, not the Chinese version usually called *yinxiang*)
6.  Insert your credentials and allow access
7.  Your content should be exported to Evernote with nice formatting :)

Unfortunately you can't see pages or place from where the comment is, but it's still better than nothing and closest as I get to solve my *note taking problem*.

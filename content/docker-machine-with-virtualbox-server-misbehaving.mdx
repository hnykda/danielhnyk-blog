I am running `docker-machine` on my Arch Linux laptop and when creating new `virtualbox` `docker-machine` by:
```bash
$ docker-machine create \ 
    --driver virtualbox \ 
    --virtualbox-cpu-count 2 \
    --virtualbox-memory 2048 pipeline
```

I had then problems with pulling new containers (and probably accessing internet in general) from the inside of the machine, e.g.:
```python
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
Building common_folder
Step 1 : FROM busybox
Pulling repository docker.io/library/busybox
ERROR: Service 'common_folder' failed to build: 
Error while pulling image: 
Get https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/library/busybox/images: 
dial tcp: lookup index.docker.io on 10.0.2.3:53: server misbehaving
```

The port `53` and weird address `10.0.2.3` gave me a hint that it is about DNS and that lead to `resolve.conf`. So I `ssh` inside the machine:
```bash
$ docker-machine ssh pipeline                                                 
```
and run
```
sudo echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
ping google.com # test the connection
```

and then it worked!
